Summertime Sadness lyrics, from Lana Del Rey:

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


Viva La Vida lyrics, from Coldplay:

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world


Fix You lyrics, from Coldplay:

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


On The Floor lyrics, from Jennifer Lopez:

J-Lo, ya tú sabes, no hay más na'
It's a new generation
Mr. Worldwide
Of party people
Get on the floor, dale, get on the floor
Red one
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, huh
I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the chain
Baby it's the truth, it's the truth
I'm like Inception
I play with your brain
So don't sleep or snooze
I don't play no games so don't, don't, don't
Don't get it confused no
'Cause you will lose yeah
Now, no pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck
Dale
If you go hard you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it movin'
Put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(Así me gusta, así me gusta, así me gusta)
(Así me gusta, así me gusta)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
I know you got it
Clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin'
Rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it movin'
Put your drinks up
It's getting ill
It's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we'd probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night aaway
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(Así me gusta, así me gusta, así me gusta)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
That badonka donk
Is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven tray donkey donk
All I need is some vodka, some chonky konk
And watch and she gon' get Donkey Kong
Baby if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me dale
Don't believe me just bet me
My name ain't Keith but I see why you sweat me
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more get on the floor
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor


Trouble Is A Friend lyrics, from Lenka:

Trouble will find you no mater where you go, oh oh
No Matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow, oh oh
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn, oh oh
Your fine for a while but then start to loose control
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine. oh oh
Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh
And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh
So don't forget as you ease on down the road
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh
Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave, I try
Oh Oh I try


Hymn For The Weekend lyrics, from Coldplay:

Me, drink from me, drink from me (oh ah)
Shoot across the symphony (oh ah, oh ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (ah, oh ah, oh ah)
That we shoot across the (I'm feeling drunk and high)
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the s- (drink from)
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood
You said, "Drink from me, drink from me"
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
(Woo)
(Ooh)
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (so high)
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the (that we shoot, yeah)
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
